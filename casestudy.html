          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>Teachers need to create and collect assessments and projects in the classroom, share with teachers, students, and parents, and organize content into multiple folders at once. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>I created Studentio, an education focused cloud storage service. For the MVP, I decided to focus on the interface for teachers, where they could upload, create, and organize content to share with students and families.</p>

        <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>For my competitive analysis I focused on Google Drive, Pinterest, and Dropbox. All three had strengths that they were free to use, with Drive and Dropbox offering paid storage solutions for those that exceed the free plan. A common strength was that the platforms made documents accessible across many devices. Common weaknesses were issues dealing with security and privacy, compatibility with older programs such a MS Office, and limited free storage.
        <br>
        <br>
        A new player in this field should be able to provide security for their users, a free storage option, and cross-device compatibility. </p>

      <section class="user-research">
        <h1>User Research</h1>
        <p>I crafted a survey that asked users what their needs were for cloud storage. I wanted to see what features they found essential, and which features they utilized the least. Since the client wanted collaborative features, I also asked how users preferred to collaborate, to find out what methods were most popular, and if social sharing was important to users. File uploading and document editing were the clear winners in terms of frequency of use, and social sharing and saving items found on the web were not important features with users. This research helped me narrow down the scope and focus on essential features for users: file uploading, document editing, and sharing through email and links. A niche audience identified was educators.</p>
